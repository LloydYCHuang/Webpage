## Hi, I am Lloyd. <br> I am a PhD student, soil lover, and future scientist.

I am Lloyd Yin-Chung Huang (黃胤中), a PhD student studying Soil Science at the University of Sydney. I began my PhD journey in late 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Budiman Minasny. Here in Sydney, I study soil spectroscopy including Visible and Near-Infrared (VisNIR) and Mid-infrared (MIR). I came from Taiwan and got my master's degree in Agricultural Chemistry from National Taiwan University. I have a broad interest in questions involved in the biogeochemical cycle and am thrilled to start my academic journey. I am passionate about research work and hold enthusiasm toward soil science.  
  
I study soil spectroscopy with a domain knowledge of pedogenesis. With the understanding of soil formation, I am expecting to deal with issues including climate change, sustainable production, smart agriculture, and even planetary exploration! My present research focuses on the application of mid-infrared on soil mineralogy and the use of low-cost spectrometers to estimate soil carbon stock.   
  
To date, I have published three peer-reviewed papers. The most recent one is published in the journal Geoderma titled "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116582" target="_blank">Using pXRF and Vis-NIR for characterizing diagnostic horizons of fine-textured podzolic soils in subtropical forests</a>." We used proximal sensors and algorithms to classify the horizons of podzolic soils, which have a significant accumulation of organo-metallic complexes. The k-means clustering successfully separated O/A, E, B, and C horizons, and we expect such methods to be applied in situ.  
   
I am a dreamer and want to be a scientist. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and hiking. I am also a gamer who enjoys soulslike games. For more information, check out my CV and Research pages. You can also contact me through email (lloyd.yc.huang@sydney.edu.au).
